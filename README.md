## Environment configuration

The code was tested with Python 3.9. Run the following commands to configurate a new conda environment:

```shell
conda create -n tgml python=3.9
conda activate tgml
python -m pip install -e ./lib
conda install -c conda-forge pygraphviz
```

The specified versions of PyTorch and its associated libraries are recommended for optimal compatibility and performance:

- **PyTorch:** 2.0.1
- **Torchvision:** 0.15.2
- **Torchaudio:** 2.0.2
- **PyTorch with CUDA:** Version 11.7

These packages can be installed using the following command:
```bash
conda install pytorch==2.0.1 torchvision==0.15.2 torchaudio==2.0.2 pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia
```

While these versions are recommended, newer versions of these libraries may also be compatible with the project. If you choose to use alternative versions, please ensure they do not introduce any compatibility issues. 



## Data and format
In the **./data** directory, you will find the CaptainCook4D data that we have defined for our task. This data is provided in compliance with the license defined by the original authors. Our split differs from those defined by the original authors of the paper, as we have only included annotations that do not contain errors. For more information about the original dataset, please visit the official [CaptainCook4D repository](https://github.com/CaptainCook4D/).

The proposed methods can be used with other datasets that follow the following JSON structure:

```JSON
{
    "annotations": {
        "1_14": {  // Unique identifier for a specific recording session [MANDATORY]
            "recording_id": "1_14",  // Identifier for the recording (e.g., video file) [OPTIONAL]
            "activity_id": 1,  // Numeric ID of the activity being performed [OPTIONAL]
            "activity_name": "Microwave Egg Sandwich",  // Name of the activity being performed [MANDATORY]
            "person_id": 1,  // ID of the person performing the task [OPTIONAL]
            "environment": 5,  // Numeric code representing the environment (e.g., kitchen type) [OPTIONAL]
            "scenario": "microwaveeggsandwich",  // Scenario name as a string (used for taxonomy linking) [MANDATORY]
            "segments": [
                {
                    "step_id": 12,  // Step number within the activity [MANDATORY]
                    "start_time": 0.799,  // Start time of the segment (in seconds) [MANDATORY]
                    "end_time": 87.74,  // End time of the segment (in seconds) [MANDATORY]
                    "description": "Cut - Cut the English muffin into two pieces with a knife",  // Text description of the action being performed [MANDATORY]
                    "has_errors": false,  // Boolean flag indicating whether this segment contains any errors [OPTIONAL]
                    "step_name": "Cut - Cut the English muffin into two pieces with a knife"  // Name of the action or step being performed [MANDATORY]
                },
              ...
            ]
          }
      ...
    },
    "taxonomy": {
        "microwaveeggsandwich": {  // Category or task label for the scenario
            "1": { // This is the same of the "id"
                "name": "Pour - Pour 1 egg into the ramekin cup",  // Name of the step in the taxonomy [MANDATORY]
                "id": 1,  // Unique ID of this step [MANDATORY]
                "is_leafnode": true,  // Boolean flag indicating if this step is a leaf node (i.e., has no substeps) [OPTIONAL]
                "parent_id": null,  // ID of the parent step (null if no parent) [OPTIONAL]
                "parent_name": null  // Name of the parent step (null if no parent) [OPTIONAL]
            },
          ...
        }
    }
}
```

***NOTE: Fields marked <u>MANDATORY</u> are required for the proposed methods to work, while fields marked <u>OPTIONAL</u> can be absent without affecting the functionality of the code.***

## Qualitative results
The figure reports the generated task graphs of the procedure called "Dressed Up Meatballs". On the left there is the ground truth task graph, while on the right the generated using the Direct Optimization model. These graphs must be interpreted from the bottom up, reflecting the bottom-up nature of dependency edges. Other qualitative results are reported in the supplementary material of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.01486).

Ground Truth             |  Generated 
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![First Image](./assets/task_graph_ground_truth.png) | ![Second Image](./assets/task_graph_generated.png)

The figure shows a success (left) and failure (right) case on EPIC-Tent. Past key-steps' colors match nodes' colors. On the left, the current key-step "Pickup/Open Stakebag" is correctly evaluated as a mistake because the step "Pickup/Place Ventcover" is a precondition of the current key-step, but it is not included among the previous key-steps. On the right, "Pickup/Open Supportbag" is incorrectly evaluated as mistake because the step "Spread Tent" is precondition of the current key-step, but it is not included among the previous key-steps. This is due to the fact that our method wrongly predicted "Spread Tent" as a pre-condition of "Pickup/Open Supportbag", probably due to the two actions often occurring in this order.
